# A simple code useful for covid-19 detection on CT Scans

A simple tensorflow and keras code useful for the covid 19 detection on CT scans. Developed on Colab, tested and trained on a downloadable dataset via: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT

The program loads the dataset (covid or not) directly from google drive. The architecture used for the classification is DenseNet121.

Enjoy.
